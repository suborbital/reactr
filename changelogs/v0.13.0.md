# TinyGo and Grain support, database capability, and more!

This release of Reactr brings some long-requested features, in particular the ability to access SQL databases! Reactr supports connecting to MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, and allows Wasm Runnables to execute pre-defined queries against them. Runnables are not allowed to execute arbitrary queries, which ensures a high standard of security when executing untrusted code.

In addition to this new capability, Reactr now officially supports two new languages: Go (via the [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org) toolchain), and [Grain](https://grain-lang.org), an awesome WebAssembly-native language! These two languages are now in preview, and we'd love your feedback. They are also integrated into the upcoming Subo Beta-2 release, which will be coming alongside Atmo Beta-4 later this week.

Along with new languages, Reactr now officially supports a new underlying WebAssembly runtime, [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev)! This is the first new runtime that we're adding support for, and more will be coming in the future. We want anyone to be able to take advantage of Reactr and Atmo, regardless of underlying runtime!

Finally, Reactr has received some significant internal performance improvements, specifically around how internal WebAssembly runtimes are managed. The work to support multiple runtimes was a good opportunity to re-architect the internal workings of the scheduler, leading to some great performance gains.

Beta-13 contains small internal breaking changes, so all users must update their Runnables to use `v0.13.0` of the various language libraries.

Thank you to [FlrnFrmm](https://github.com/FlrnFrmm) and [willemneal](https://github.com/willemneal]) for their contributions to the updated Rust crate, which now includes some easy-to-use macros for generating Runnables, as well as a totally refactored internal code structure.
